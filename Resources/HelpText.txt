random thinking:

Creating a feed:

	coapp --load-config=feed.properties generate-feed

	feed.properties:

	[feed]
	output-file=c:\inetpub\wwwroot\package-feed.xml
	root-url=http://coapp.org

	# default for actual-url is derrived from root-url & output-file
	# actual-url=http://coapp.org/package-feed.xml         

	package-source=c:\inetpub\wwwroot\packages 
	recursive
	package-url=/packages/
	
	# or to specifiy the absolute prefix for packages, add the scheme:
	# package-url=http://coapp.org/packages/

	title=CoApp Base Packages 


Installing from a feed:
    coapp install c:\app-feed.atom 
    coapp --maximium=50 install http://serack.org/favorite-feed.atom

Installing a single package from a feed:
    coapp --scan=http://serack.org/favorite-feed.atom install scite
    

Explicitly ask for a Coapp Package:
    coapp install pkg:Appone-1.0.0.0-x86 
    
    (should be the same as:)
    coapp install AppOne-1.0.0.0-x86

coapp install nuget:packagename[-version]
coapp install msi:foo.msi 
coapp install openwrap:foo-x
