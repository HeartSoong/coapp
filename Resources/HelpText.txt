random thinking:

Installing from a feed:
	coapp install c:\app-feed.atom 
	coapp --maximium=50 install http://serack.org/favorite-feed.atom

Installing a single package from a feed:
	coapp --scan=http://serack.org/favorite-feed.atom install scite
	

Explicitly ask for a Coapp Package:
	coapp install pkg:Appone-1.0.0.0-x86 
	
	(should be the same as:)
	coapp install AppOne-1.0.0.0-x86

coapp install nuget:packagename[-version]
coapp install msi:foo.msi 
coapp install openwrap:foo-x
